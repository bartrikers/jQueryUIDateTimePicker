# jQueryUIDateTimePicker
A simple alternative to the built-in Mendix datepicker, that uses the jQueryUI Datepicker and Trent Richardson's Timepicker addon (http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/).

Some key-features:
- select picker type (datepicker, timepicker, or datetimepicker)
- set date and timeformat
- set a year and/or time range
- set a custom placeholder text
- select several themes, including a Mendix based theme
